/*
   1. Write a C++ program (or Java program) for hw3_1 that reads the number of input values from a user.
   Then, read the input values from the user. After that, your program should display them in the ascending
   order. When you display the numbers, you have to use a short representation if there are consecutive
   numbers. For example, if there are three numbers such as 51, 52, and 53 in the input values, you have to
   display them 51â€“53 to save space. For the assignment, you can assume that the input values are positive
   integers and unique (= No duplications in the input numbers).
   Input format: This is a sample input from a user.

   51
